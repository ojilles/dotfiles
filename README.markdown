Jilles Oldenbeuving's dotfiles
==========

Good idea?
---------
Probably not. Don't use this, I'm no expert, this is bug ridden and
probably offends any amount of unicorns out there. That said, I
needed an easy way to synch these files across multiple Macs, so
there you go.

Usage
---------
Install rake. Run that.
