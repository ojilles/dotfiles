Jilles Oldenbeuving's dotfiles
==========

Good idea?
---------
Probably not. Don't use this, I'm no expert, this is bug ridden and
probably offends any amount of unicorns out there. That said, I
needed an easy way to synch these files across multiple Macs, so
there you go.

Usage
---------
Just check this out in your homedirectory and you're set. Be carefull
though! In order to check this out, clone it into a subdir, then
move all files (including .git!) to your homedirectory

NEW: Need to install Janus in order for all of this to work now.
